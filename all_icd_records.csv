Mumps induced orchitis typically presents 1-2 weeks after parotitis. The virus’ infiltration into the testicular glands can cause parenchymal inflammation, separation of seminiferous tubules and perivascular interstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Testicular atrophy can result from a rise in intratesticular pressure. Complications include oligospermia, azoospermia, and asthenospermia, which can contribute to subfertility. Infertility is more common in patients with bilateral mumps orchitis and is estimated to occur in approximately 13% of all patients. Sterility is rarely induced by mumps orchitis."

Pulmonary toxoplasmosis in the immunodeficient patient may appear in the form of interstitial pneumonitis, necrotizing pneumonitis, consolidation, pleural effusion, or empyema, or all of these.[1] AIDS patients with Toxoplasma pneumonia present with cough, dyspnoea, and fever. As toxoplasmosis is generally seen only in advanced HIV infection with CD4 counts below 100, the majority of AIDS patients who develop toxoplasma pneumonia already have had previous HIV-associated opportunistic infections. In solid organ transplant patients, this is most commonly due to transplantation of a toxoplasma-seropositive lung or heart into a seronegative recipient, resulting in primary pulmonary disease. In bone marrow transplant patients, pulmonary toxoplasmosis occurs in 0.28% to 0.45% of patients. Unlike solid organ transplant patients, most of these patients have reactivation, not primary disease.[2] Source: [1]Montoya JG, et al. Toxoplasma gondii.

The disorder is heterogeneous, ranging from skin lesions that may spontaneously regress to highly aggressive neoplasms associated with multiorgan failure and short survival. Subtypes of mastocytosis are recognised mainly by the distribution of the disease and clinical manifestations. In cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), the mast cell infiltration remains confined to the skin, whereas systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterised by involvement of at least one extracutaneous organ with or without evidence of skin lesions. Mastocytosis should be strictly separated from mast cell hyperplasia or mast cell activation states without morphological and/or molecular abnormalities that characterize the neoplastic proliferation."

In the absence of extramedullary tissue involvement, there must be ?5x109/L monoclonal lymphocytes with a CLL phenotype in the PB. The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic leukaemia (IWCLL) report requires that the lymphocytosis be present for at least 3 months and also allows for the diagnosis of CLL to be made with lower lymphocyte counts in patients with cytopenias or disease-related symptoms {873A}. Whether patients who would have fulfilled the criteria in the past for CLL but who fulfill the criteria only for monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) are better considered to have low stage CLL or MBL remains to be determined. Some may prefer to still consider many of these cases more like CLL. The term SLL is used for non-leukaemic cases with the tissue morphology and immunophenotype of CLL. The IWCLL definition of SLL requires lymphadenopathy, no cytopenias due to BM infiltration by CLL/SLL and <5x109/L PB B-cells {873A}."

It shows marked geographic differences, with highest incidence rates in Southern Chinese. In some endemic areas, the incidence has declined by about 30% over the past two decades, suggesting that environmental or lifestyle factors may play a major role and that the disease is, to some extent, preventable. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows a very strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, irrespective of the ethnic origin of the patients. This association has pioneered a new paradigm of utilizing viral serological tests for the diagnosis of cancer and for screening in high-risk populations. Naso -pharyngeal carcinoma is generally responsive to radiation therapy, and the clinical outcome has greatly improved over the years, due to refinements in staging and to improved therapy protocols. The unusual and often deceptive histological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma have generated controversies over the nature of the tumour and still pose a challenge to surgical pathologists. There have possibly been more names invented for the various histological subtypes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma than any other tumour type."

HBV vaccination has become a powerful tool in reducing cirrhosis and HCC, but implementation is still suboptimal in several high risk regions. In Western countries, chronic alcohol abuse is a major aetiological factor. Hepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a different geographical distribution, with peak incidences in Northern Thailand.

These include neoplasms derived from mucosal epithelium, seromucinous glands, soft tissues, bone, cartilage, neural/neuroectodermal tissue, haematolymphoid cells and the odontogenic apparatus. Many of the tumours are similar to those found elsewhere in the body but a few, such as the olfactory neuroblastoma, are unique to this site."

The number of cases has continuously increased over the past decades, partly due to the higher life expectancy. An additional factor is the Western lifestyle, characterised by a highly caloric diet and lack of physical exercise. Epidemiological data indicates that black people are most susceptible, followed by white people, while Asian people have the lowest risk. The extent to which prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by PSA screening, is currently being evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis and grading play a major role in the management of prostate cancer"

The former is an uncommon precancerous disease of penile skin. Lesions usually appear on the glans or inner aspect of the foreskin and are almost always found in uncircumcised men. If left untreated, 10-30% of cases develop into invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. When it affects the skin of the shaft or prepuce it is commonly called Bowen disease. If it affects the glans or inner surface of the prepuce it may also be referred to as penile intraepithelial neoplasia (or in the past as erythroplasia of Queyrat). Extramammary Paget disease of penis is a rare form of carcinoma in situ involving penile skin or glans penis."

In mild cases, night blindness is apparent only after photic stress. Affected children no longer move around after dusk and prefer to sit in a secure corner, often unable to find their food or toys. Night blindness of recent onset in a preschool child is practically pathognomonic of vitamin A deficiency. All patients respond rapidly to therapy with vitamin A, usually within 48 hours."
http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2023-01/mms/1544242475,Vitamin A deficiency with conjunctival xerosis,5B55.1,,"In conjunctival xerosis the epithelium of the conjunctiva is transformed from the normal columnar to the stratified squamous type, with a resultant loss of goblet cells, formation of a granular cell layer, and keratinization of the surface. Clinically, these changes are expressed as marked dryness or unwettability, the affected area appearing roughened, with fine droplets or bubbles on the surface, rather than smooth and glistening. Conjunctival xerosis first appears in the temporal quadrant, as an isolated oval or triangular patch adjacent to the limbus in the interpalpebral fissure. It is almost always present in both eyes."

The entire conjunctiva appears dry, roughened, and corrugated, sometimes skin-like. In some individuals keratin and saprophytic bacilli accumulate on the xerotic surface, giving it a foamy or cheesy appearance. Such lesions are known as Bitot's spot. With treatment active conjunctival xerosis and Bitot's spot begin to resolve within 2-5 days. Most will disappear within 2 weeks, though a significant proportion of temporal lesions may persist, in shrunken form, for months."
http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2023-01/mms/1307433024,Vitamin A deficiency with corneal xerosis,5B55.3,,"Clinically, the cornea develops classical xerosis, a hazy, lustreless, dry appearance, first apparent near the inferior limbus. Many children have characteristic superficial punctate lesions of the inferior-nasal aspects of their cornea that stain brightly with fluorescein. Early in the disease they are visible only through a slit-lamp examination. With more severe disease the punctate lesions become more numerous and spread upwards over the central cornea, and the corneal stroma becomes oedematous. Thick, keratinized plaques resembling Bitot's spot may form on the corneal surface. These are often densest in the interpalpebral zone. With treatment, these corneal plaques peel off, sometimes leaving superficial erosion which quickly heals. Corneal xerosis responds within 2-5 days to vitamin A therapy, the cornea regaining its normal appearance in 1-2 weeks."

Ulcers are classically round to oval ""punched-out"" defects, as if a trephine or cork-borer had been applied to the eye. The surrounding cornea is generally xerotic but otherwise clear, and typically lacks the grey, infiltrated appearance of ulcers of bacterial origin. There may be more than one ulcer. Small ulcers are almost invariably confined to the periphery of the cornea, especially its inferior and nasal aspects. The ulceration may be shallow, but is commonly deep. Perforations become plugged with iris, thereby preserving the anterior chamber. In more advanced disease the necrotic stroma sloughs, leaving a large ulcer or descemetocele. As with smaller ulcers, this is usually peripheral and heals as a dense, white, adherent leukoma. With therapy, superficial ulcers often heal with surprisingly little scarring; deeper ulcers, especially perforations, form dense peripheral adherent leukomas."

Healed sequelae of prior corneal disease related to vitamin A deficiency include opacities or scars of varying density (nebula, macula, leukoma), weakening and outpouching of the remaining corneal layers (staphyloma and descemetocele) and, where loss of intraocular contents has occurred, phthisis bulbi, a scarred shrunken globe. Such end-stage lesions are not specific for xerophthalmia and may arise from numerous other conditions, notably trauma and infection."

Many cases of thiamine deficiency show a mixture of the two main features and are more properly termed thiamine deficiency with cardiopathy and peripheral neuropathy. The infant shows signs of cyanosis and an acute cardiac attack can follow with the infant usually dying within 2 to 4 hours. The common age for this form of the deficiency disease is one month up through the third month. This type of deficiency responds very dramatically to thiamine."

Hypovitaminosis B6 may often occur with riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency. The classical clinical symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency are a seborrheic dermatitis, microcytic anaemia, epileptiform convulsions, and depression and confusion. Infants are especially susceptible to insufficient intakes, which can lead to epileptiform convulsions. Moreover, there is usually a decrease in circulating lymphocytes and sometimes a normocytic, microcytic, or sideroblastic anaemia as well. As is the case with other micronutrient deficiencies, vitamin B6 deficiency results in an impairment of the immune system. Several medical conditions can also affect vitamin B6 metabolism and thus lead to deficiency symptoms."

This can be exacerbated by malabsorption conditions, including coeliac disease and tropical sprue. Pregnant women are at risk for folate deficiency because pregnancy significantly increases the folate requirement, especially during periods of rapid fetal growth (i.e. in the second and third trimester). During lactation, losses of folate in milk also increase the folate requirement. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs), with risk increasing 10-fold as folate status goes from adequate to poor. Between days 21 and 27 post-conception, the neural plate closes to form what will eventually be the spinal cord and cranium. Spina bifida, anencephaly, and other similar conditions are collectively called NTDs. They result from improper closure of the spinal cord and cranium, respectively, and are the most common congenital abnormalities associated with folate deficiency."

Clinical findings are: dermatitis, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. The role of EFA during pregnancy and lactation has been highlighted, and the role of long-chain n-3 fatty acids as structural components for the development of the retinal function and central nervous system is now accepted. The prenatal period is a time of increased risk for omega-3 deficiency, as maternal tissue stores tend to decline as they are used for the developing fetus. Deficiency of n-3 EFA can affect growth, and cognitive and visual function in infants. The characteristic signs of deficiency attributed to the n-6 fatty acids are scaly skin rash, increased transepidermal water loss, reduced growth, and elevation of the plasma ratio of eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid. EFA deficiency in special populations has been linked to hematologic disturbances and diminished immune response. Long-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are essential nutrients and also, as part of the overall fat supply may affect the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and age-related functional decline."

Hypervitaminosis A appears to be due to abnormal transport and distribution of vitamin A and retinoids caused by overloading of the plasma transport mechanisms. Very high single doses can cause transient acute toxic symptoms that may include bulging fontanelles in infants; headaches in older children and adults; and vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, and irritability in all age groups.

Possible cardiac findings are hypertension, decreased Q-T interval and arrhythmias. The central nervous system effects of hypercalcaemia include lethargy, hypotonia, confusion, disorientation, depression, psychosis, hallucinations and coma. Hypercalcaemia impairs renal concentrating mechanisms, which can lead to polyuria, dehydration and hypernatremia. Hypercalcaemia can also lead to acute renal failure, nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, which can result in chronic renal insufficiency.

Patients with moderate to severe hypercalcaemia often complain of nausea and vomiting, symptoms likely related to dehydration as well as to the effects of the hypercalcaemia on central nervous system function.

Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder.

Depersonalization is characterised by experiencing the self as strange or unreal, or feeling detached from, or as though one were an outside observer of, one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions. Derealization is characterised by experiencing other persons, objects, or the world as strange or unreal (e.g., dreamlike, distant, foggy, lifeless, colourless, or visually distorted) or feeling detached from one’s surroundings.

Alcohol—more specifically termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol—is an intoxicating compound produced by fermentation of sugars usually in agricultural products such as fruits, cereals, and vegetables with or without subsequent distillation. There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic course. Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol). Several alcohol-induced mental disorders (e.g., Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder) and alcohol-related forms of neurocognitive impairment (e.g., Dementia Due to Use of Alcohol) are recognized."

Cannabis is the collective term for a range of psychoactive preparations of the cannabis plant, Cannabis sativa, and related species and hybrids. Cannabis contains cannabinoids, a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on endogenous cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release in the brain. The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is typically smoked in the form of the flowering heads or leaves of the marijuana plant; tobacco is often mixed with cannabis when smoked. There are also cannabis oils that are prepared from these same sources. These preparations vary considerably in their THC potency. Cannabis has predominantly central nervous system depressant effects and produces a characteristic euphoria that may be part of the presenting features of Cannabis Intoxication, which may also include impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. Cannabis has dependence-producing properties resulting in Cannabis Dependence in some people and Cannabis Withdrawal when use is reduced or discontinued.

Synthetic cannabinoids are synthesized diverse chemical compounds that are potent agonists for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. There are several hundred such compounds. The synthetic compound is typically sprayed onto a vehicle such as cannabis or tea leaves and then smoked. The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior). Synthetic Cannabinoid Intoxication may therefore present more frequently with psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids are also dependence-producing and Synthetic Cannabinoid Dependence and Synthetic Cannabinoid Withdrawal are recognized.

Opioids is a generic term that encompasses the constituents or derivatives of the opium poppy Papaver somniferum as well as a range of synthetic and semisynthetic compounds, some related to morphine and others chemically distinct but all having their primary actions on the µ opioid receptor. Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons. In some countries morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids is greater than that related to heroin. All opioids may result in Opioid Intoxication, Opioid Dependence and Opioid Withdrawal. A range of Opioid-Induced Disorders occur, some of which occur following Opioid Withdrawal."

Prescribed stimulants including dexamphetamine are indicated for a limited number of conditions such as for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Methcathinone, known in many countries as ephedrone, is a synthetic potent stimulant that is a structural analogue of methamphetamine and is related to cathinone. All these drugs have primarily psychostimulant properties and are also vasoconstrictors to a varying degree. They induce euphoria and hyperactivity as may be seen in Stimulant Intoxication. They have potent dependence-producing properties, which may lead to the diagnosis of Stimulant Dependence and Stimulant Withdrawal following the cessation of use.

Dissociative drugs include ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP) and their (comparatively rare) chemical analogues. Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic widely used in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, and in emergency situations. Ketamine is also undergoing evaluation for treatment of some mental disorders (e.g., treatment resistant Depressive Disorders). It is also a widespread drug of nonmedical use in many countries and may be taken by the oral or nasal routes or injected. It produces a sense of euphoria but depending on the dose, emergent hallucinations and dissociation are recognised as unpleasant side effects. Phencyclidine has a more restricted worldwide distribution and also has euphoric and dissociative effects. Its use may result in bizarre behaviour uncharacteristic for the individual, including self-harm. Dissociative Drug Dependence is described but a withdrawal syndrome is not recognized by most authorities. Several Dissociative Drug-Induced Mental Disorders are recognised."

These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the specified substances. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of the specified substances, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of the specified substances, or repeated use of the specified substances or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if use of the specified substances is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months."

Non-psychoactive substances include laxatives, growth hormone, erythropoietin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They may also include proprietary or over-the-counter medicines and folk remedies. Non-medical use of these substances may be associated with harm to the individual due to the direct or secondary toxic effects of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a harmful route of administration (e.g., infections due to intravenous self-administration). They are not associated with intoxication or with a dependence or withdrawal syndrome and are not recognized causes of substance-induced mental disorders."

These can be sporadic, genetic (caused by mutations in the prion-protein gene), or transmissible (acquired from an infected individual). Onset is insidious and there is a rapid progression of symptoms and impairment characterised by cognitive deficits, ataxia, and motor symptoms (myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia). Diagnosis is typically made on the basis of brain imaging studies, presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid, EEG, or genetic testing."

http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2023-01/mms/702771512,Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy,BC43.6,,"Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy is a cardiomyopathy characterised by myocardial cell loss with partial or total replacement of right ventricular muscle by adipose and fibrous tissue, beginning subepicardially to become transmural in time, sparing the papillary muscles and trabeculae, and often associated with aneurysms particularly of the right ventricular outflow tract. There is progressive systolic impairment with ventricular dilation and marked propensity for ventricular arrhythmias of right, as well as left, ventricular origin. Classically a disease of the right ventricle, more recent evidence suggests left ventricular involvement to a varying extent in up to 75% of cases, as well as isolated left ventricular disease. Source: ISNPCHD and American Heart Association Scientific Statement 2019 Additional information: Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (AVC/D) is a heart muscle disease clinically characterised by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Its prevalence has been estimated to vary from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000 and is a major cause of sudden death in the young and in athletes. Classically a disease of the right ventricle, more recent evidence suggests left ventricular involvement to a varying extent in up to 75% of cases, as well as isolated left ventricular disease. The clinical picture may include: a subclinical phase without symptoms and with ventricular fibrillation being the first presentation; an electrical disorder with palpitations and syncope, due to tachyarrhythmias of right ventricular origin (left bundle branch block pattern) but also of left ventricular origin (right bundle branch block pattern) when left ventricular disease present; right ventricular or biventricular pump failure, so severe as to require transplantation. The pathology consists of a genetically determined dystrophy of the right (or left) ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement which may lead to right ventricular aneurysms. The causative genes (ACTN2, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, TMEM43, LDB3, PKP2, RYR2, TGFB3) encode proteins of mechanical cell junctions (plakoglobin, plakophilin, desmoglein, desmocollin, desmoplakin) and account for intercalated disk remodelling. Familial occurrence with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance has been reported. Recessive variants associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair (see these terms) have also been described. Classically clinical diagnosis depends on demonstrating functional and structural alterations of the right ventricle (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging), ECG depolarization and repolarization abnormalities, arrhythmias with the left bundle branch block morphology and fibro-fatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. Electroanatomic mapping is able to detect areas of low voltage corresponding to myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. The main differential diagnoses are idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis (see these terms). Management includes antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Young age, family history of juvenile sudden death, QRS dispersion greater than or equal to 340 ms, T-wave inversion, left ventricular involvement, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and prior cardiac arrest are the major risk factors for an adverse prognosis."

The development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy has been linked to impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities."

The retention of sinus secretions is the most important event in the development of sinusitis. This creates a favourable milieu for the growth of infection agents and may be caused by the obstruction or narrowing of sinus ostia, mucociliary dysfunction and changes in mucus composition. 90% of sinus infections involve the maxillary sinus. Chronic sinusitis refers to symptom duration lasting 3 months or more. Diagnosis of sinusitis is based on past history and physical examination findings. The CT scan is the most sensitive technique in evaluating sinus disease. The goals of management of chronic sinusitis are to eradicate infection, to relieve ostiomeatal obstruction, to normalize mucociliary clearance, and to prevent complications. When pharmaceutical treatment does not have any remarkable improvement or when a surgical approach can be chosen as patient's complication, surgical intervention should be aimed to establish an effective sinus drainage from the ostium. . Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) describes endoscopic techniques that have revolutionized the approach to sinus disease.

Obesity predisposes to but is not necessary for its development. The term is in widespread use but is misleading as it has nothing to do with cellulitis. The condition is asymptomatic but may cause considerable embarrassment."

Additional information: This code is used by some as synonymous with the perimembranous, conoventricular, Type II, or the paramembranous defects. Although best used to describe the perimembranous defect that opens centrally at the base of the right ventricle, this term might be used to code perimembranous defects with inlet or outlet extension. It is recommended, however, that the more precise terms be used whenever possible for coding the latter lesions. It should also not be used to code an inlet ventricular septal defect, or the so-called atrioventricular canal ventricular septal defect. More specific terms exist for coding these entities. It is used by some to describe an isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect without extension, although it is unlikely that perimembranous defects exist in the absence of deficiency of their muscular perimeter. The conoventricular ventricular septal defect with malalignment should be coded as an outlet defect, as should the perimembranous defect opening to the outlet of the right ventricle. Such defects can also extend to become doubly committed and juxta-arterial (conal septal hypoplasia) when there is also fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial valves or when there is a common arterial valve.

The ileal atresia is more common than jejunal atresia, and multiple foci are more common than isolated atresia. The most accepted theory regarding the etiology of jejunoileal atresia is that of an intrauterine vascular accident resulting in necrosis of the affected segment. Stenosis, on the other hand, refers to a partial occlusion with incomplete obstruction and accounts for the remaining 5% of cases. A stenosis has an intact mesentery and is a localised narrowing of the bowel. No loss of continuity of the lumen exists."

The most common causes of myoglobinuria in adults are trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, usually in relation to muscle necrosis from prolonged immobilization and pressure by the body weight. Prolonged ethanol consumption and seizure activity, similar to excessive physical activity, can produce an imbalance between muscle energy consumption and production, resulting in muscle destruction."

Evidence of a preceding seizure may be present or not. A “definite SUDEP” is confirmed if a postmortem examination does not reveal an alternative cause of death. If such examination lacks, but potentially lethal alternative causes are excluded and all other criteria are met, the death is labelled as “probable SUDEP”. The term “possible SUDEP” is used in cases with competing causes of death or when data are insufficient to reasonably allow their classification. The term “SUDEP plus” applies when a patient also suffered from other diseases that may have contributed to the death, but there are no clues that the alternative condition has truly caused it. Cases in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation prevented the death are called “near-SUDEP”."

Diseases can manifest in many ways and in different body systems. Such specific manifestations may be a reason for treatment or encounter, with or without identifying or addressing the underlying condition.   Categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown aetiology' or 'transient'. The conditions and signs or symptoms included in this chapter consist of: - cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated - signs or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined; - provisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care; - cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made; - cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason;  - certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right. These categories should be used in conjunction with a code from another chapter that identifies the underlying condition."

The mandibular condylar process comprises three fracture levels and is subdivided into the head region, the condylar neck, and the condylar base. Fractures of the condylar head show typical fracture lines either within the lateral pole zone, which may lead to loss of vertical height, or medially to the pole zone, with the latter ones usually not compromising the vertical condyle to disc and fossa relation. Fractures of the condylar neck and base can be differentiated according to radiologically based rules with regard to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch, and are basically subdivided according to the presence or absence of displacement or dislocation. Further parameters for definition are presence or absence of fragmentation, sideward displacement (medially or laterally), angulation of the superior main fragment and fracture-site geometry (e.g. straight or oblique, interfragmentary interdigitation)"

The mandibular condylar process comprises three fracture levels and is subdivided into the head region, the condylar neck, and the condylar base. Fractures of the condylar head show typical fracture lines either within the lateral pole zone, which may lead to loss of vertical height, or medially to the pole zone, with the latter ones usually not compromising the vertical condyle to disc and fossa relation. Fractures of the condylar neck and base can be differentiated according to radiologically based rules with regard to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch, and are basically subdivided according to the presence or absence of displacement or dislocation. Further parameters for definition are presence or absence of fragmentation, sideward displacement (medially or laterally), angulation of the superior main fragment and fracture-site geometry (e.g. straight or oblique, interfragmentary interdigitation)"

http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2023-01/mms/435227771,"Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes",22,,"!markdown In the ICD, injury means physical or physiological bodily harm resulting from interaction of the body with energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical or radiant, or due to extreme pressure) in an amount, or at a rate of transfer, that exceeds physical or physiological tolerance. Injury can also result from lack of vital elements, such as oxygen. Poisoning by and toxic effects of substances are included, as is damage of or due to implanted devices.   Injury usually has rapid onset in response to a well-defined event (e.g. a car crash, striking the ground after falling, drinking a strongly alkaline liquid, an overdose of a medication, a burn sustained during a surgical procedure). These events are often referred to as external causes of injury. The injurious energy can, however, originate from the injured person and/or from his or her immediate environment (e.g. a person running on a hot day sustains heat exhaustion), and injury can be caused by the injured person (i.e. intentional self-harm). Injury includes manifestations that are evident immediately after onset, which may persist or not, and manifestations that first become evident at a later date."

http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2023-01/mms/850137482,External causes of morbidity or mortality,23,,"!markdown The WHO definition of an ‘injury’ is: ‘Injuries are caused by acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy, heat, electricity, chemicals, and ionizing radiation interacting with the body in amounts or at rates that exceed the threshold of human tolerance. In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat’. Injuries may be categorized in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are: - unintentional (i.e. accidental) - intentional (i.e. deliberate): - interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide) - self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide) - legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel) - war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots) - undetermined intent Regarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply. See section ‘Definition related to transport accidents’."
